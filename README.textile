CPanelBackup helps you generate and restore CPanel backups. It was initially written as Bacula pre-job-run hook, but was quickly expanded to do more.

h2. Usage

Use the CLI script provided, run @cpb_runner --help@ to see all the options.

Now let's go through the backup process.

h3. Backing up stuff

* Bacula runs a job.
** Bacula invokes pre-run hook on the client (@cpb_runner@)
** Bacula backups _/home_ & _/backups/cpanelbackup/accounts_ dirs

The hook is invoked with the following options:

bc. cpb_runner --action backup

The script now backups *all* cpanel accounts into _/backups/cpanelbackup/accounts_ dir, where CPanel *pkgacct* 's *.tar files are placed.

h3. Restoring

* Something initiates backup restoral
** Backup files are placed into:
*** CPanel backups (tar): _/backups/cpanelbackup/backups/cpanelbackup/accounts_
*** Home dir backups (plain): _/backups/cpanelbackup/home_
** User runs @cpb_runner@ script

The script should be run as following:

bc. cpb_runner --action restore --users theusername  --home-rsync --delete-source --smart-id

This will ask cpb to move _theusername.tar_ file from _/backups/cpanelbackup/backups/cpanelbackup/accounts/_ to _/backups/cpanelbackup/accounts/_ dir, restore from it, rsync home dir from _/backups/cpanelbackup/home/theusername/_ to _/home/theusername/_ and delete all backup data for that user afterwards in case of success.
